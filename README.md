Forecasting Energy Consumption


In today’s fast-paced industrial world, numerous projects are underway to meet the needs of the people, with
energy consumption playing an increasingly important role that must be appropriately utilized in the future.
As a result, optimizing energy consumption has become a top priority for the government. The goal of the
project is to perform high level exploratory data analysis and build different time series models which will
help in forecasting the energy consumption in future.

Machine learning is very good at analyzing time series data. Firstly, time series data is all about a set of
measurements that happen in a constant or a periodic time frame. Time is the independent variable here. It is
a collection of sequential data points and analyzing them will help us in understanding the underlying concept
of the data points and the relations and help in optimizing the solutions for a better cause. In this project
analyzing the power consumption data set will help in optimizing the power distribution among the states and
helps in budling economic status of the country.

The major goals of the project are:
1. To analyze the period where most and least amount of the energy is consumed.
2. To build a prediction model to predict the energy consumed in the state
3. To compare the result metrices of the RNN, LSTM, XG-BOOST algorithms and state the state the
best algorithm
4. Also, to provide the future scope and improvisations based on our current study.

We tried to expand the dataset by columns and visualized the power consumption through different types of
timeseries components such as year, date, time, month, quarter, isweekday etc.


Project Impact
Based on the observation on the models that are fitted we state that RNN model works better, As we have
data till 2018, we can try to synthesize the data to get feature consumption values and try to optimize the
consumption of the energy distribution among the grids. This will highly impact the economic status of the
country as proposed and help in protecting the non-renewable resources.


Future Work:
1. Modeling the energy consumption and predicting the future demand of energy to be distributed in
the power distribution sectors is a challenging task.
2. Moreover, the noise disturbance and uncertain nature of weather conditions also play a
backbreaking step to predict the rate of energy consumption. In this context, we implement a
powerful RNN based energy consumption prediction model which is validated by simulating with
the hourly based collected data set.
3. Additionally, the performance of the proposed model was evaluated through the performance
metrics. We aim to incorporate various dimensional dataset such as the occupant’s behavior and
the climate condition to verify and test the predicted variable of our proposed network as the further
research work.
